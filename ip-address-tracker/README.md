## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Ipify](https://www.ipify.org/)
- [Leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/)

### What I learned
It was amazing to build a fully functional wroking website with using multiple apis in a single webapp. I learned a lot about `ipify` and `leaflet` api and earned a lot of experance. And now I know how to implement map in a website or app this was new for me And I enjoyed it.
